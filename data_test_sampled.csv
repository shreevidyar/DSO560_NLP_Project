7063333,"A ""mental health problem"" sez the Prez who never knew the guy or his circumstances. Maybe he was just having a bad day. We may never know.  

Over a month ago, a gunman wiped out the lives of dozens in Las Vegas.  Last night, CNN reported, 
""[Sheriff Joseph] Lombardo said ... that he did not know whether money troubles led to the shooting. He reiterated that the motive remains elusive. ""What is the reason why?"" he asked rhetorically at one point. ""We haven't gotten that answer yet. There was something that popped his trigger or caused him to go into that direction and we have yet to determine what that is,"" Lombardo added. ""I hope we find something in the pathology of his brain that helps us understand this.""

We may never know for sure. But one thing's for sure: at this point Nevada law enforcement ISN'T talking ""mental health problem"" because maybe the guy just...didn't...have one.  But he did have access to guns.  Lots and lots of guns. 4,000 rounds of ammo, too.

Care must be taken, however, to ensure that Canadian efforts in this regard do not suggest that Canada, faced with bullying tactics, is prepared to settle for disadvantageous terms or to side inappropriately with the US at Mexico's expense.

Hard bargaining by each of the three NAFTA member States is to be expected and Canada must be prepared to give way on some issues if this can lead to changes that, on balance, improve North American trading conditions.  However, Canada must strongly resist pressure to make unilateral concessions or to become the junior partner in efforts to gang up with the US against third nations.

I cannot speak to what may be going on in the hearts of the church's leadership.  What I CAN do, is talk about what we see ad read, and add my thoughts.

In the context of this thread, I should think that the real fear that should set in as the anger and responses to this kind of story fades, is what is taking the place of that anger and outrage, is a sense of apathy.  For the bishops, I cannot imagine such a malaise could be good for the church.  Yet, they (the church's leadership) do not give the laity a voice, nor any power here.  I cannot imagine most Catholics being ""happy"" with the church's response.  That it draws anger could even be seen as good, because it means the church's members still care, and feel ""vested"" in it.  As that sense fades towards apathy, anything the bishops do or do NOT do will no longer matter.  We're disconnecting.

Kakistocracy:

Kakistocracy is a term meaning a state or country run by the worst, least qualified, or most unscrupulous citizens.

The word comes from the Greek words kakistos (κάκιστος; worst) and kratos (κράτος; rule), with a literal meaning of government by the worst people.

The baker's position is that the unique consulting, designing, creating, delivery, setup, etc. involved with a wedding cake forces him to be a participant in an event he considers a mockery of a sacred rite (the marriage ceremony) as practiced in his religion.  This is arguably a greater (and Constitutional) harm than merely being offended. The wedding participation part is that to which he objects.

I have a similar such asset rattling around in my own financial detritus.........not $205K but $20K.

The cousin graduated from university and now has a thriving law practice in the lower mainland.

I started pressing my cousin for repayment of the loan in the late 1990s but she now denies any responsibility for the loan. Her parents (who witnessed the loan passing to their daughter) died years ago.

I had great respect for my uncle and aunt but I hope to cause at least $20K worth of grief for my deadbeat cousin before I die.

I agree. And liberty, to me, means that adults have the right to distribute and partake in whatever they please as long as it doesn't harm others or impede the liberty of others. Believing in the nanny state where the government heavily regulates what is ""bad for you"" you get the war on drugs. We treat drug abusers who are people suffering from addiction like criminals and put incentive into the hands of criminals to distribute. I'd rather have the sick people out in the open and remove the incentive of criminals. When it comes to harsher substances like heroin or meth those shouldn't become legal but we shouldn't treat it's victims as criminals, just it's perpetuators. Sweden has some interesting things its trying in this regard.

There have been more communities that have retained or initiated fluoridation than have ""voted it out"".  However, a community that ""votes it out"" does nothing to validate the FOs' claims - it only means that their fear-mongering propaganda has been successful in scaring the public.  Fear - whether accurate and rational or not - is a powerful motivator, and FOs are masters at spreading unwarranted fear.

Tuckerman Babcock did not go after any one of those 3 traitors until they joined with democrats to form a new majority. In fact, Louise Stutes asked the ARP for money and she was given money for her campaign. When she jumped ship Tuckerman Babcock asked for that money back. She announced at a recent SCC meeting that she donated that money to the Salvation Army thrift store on Kodiak instead of returning it to ARP. Seaton, Stutes, and LaDeux violated Republican Party rules when they jumped ship, thus they will be campaigned against and defeated in 2018. That rule has been in effect since the Senate had the same problem a number of years ago - and our state government grew exponentially during the time of their reign. When will we learn?

You wisely invest the remaining 50% and cash out on the interest from that investment. Now the state taxes you another 50% when you collect that interest. The state is taxing you 50% of everything related to your widget earnings. Meanwhile the state gives your renter a cut of your earnings, ""tax credit"".

_________________________________________________
This is not correct.

Harper changed the healthcare annual increase from 6% to an increase that is tied to Nominal GDP growth with a minimum increase of 3%.

What Trudeau offered was a flat 3.5% which the provinces rejected because it is actually LESS than what Harper offered when you calculate the increases over several years in line with increases to the nominal GDP.  It was a bait and switch by Trudeau and Moreau who didn't think that the provincial finance ministers could do math and he got called on it.  The side deals he signed kept the Harper figures.

Fortunately for Trudeau, journalists can't do math and the average Canadian relies on journalists for information.",test,2017-01-04 19:50:41.683564+00,54,,159835,approved,0,0,0,1,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,4

7121578,"Spot on. Morning daylight is good for the kids. Heck, it's good for all of us. Should we recognize that our educational system is outdated, impractical and expensive? I blame neither teachers, administration, students, unions, corporations, nor legislators. Human nature is what it is, right! Don't get me wrong, the institutions of education are necessary. But, do the current systems reflect today's requirements and tomorrow's needs? For many hundreds of years, perhaps thousands, we have lived an ass-backward competitive existence. Living the proverbial ""rat race"" by clawing and tearing at each other to make ends meet. If we were to live a combinative existence, however, we chose enlightenment, growth, and security. How can this be done? I'm not talking about building a perfect society. A society without conflict and war is too fanciful a concept for this Alaskan. 

Technology can set us free by combinative behavior.

Taking a SWAG (Scientific Wild-Ass Guess) I'd say that what's pictured is a movie prop gun using either a Colt 1849 ""Wells Fargo"" or a Colt 1851 Navy cap and ball revolver as a starting point.  What's shown appears to actually be a cartridge conversion (to enable the firing of blanks?) as suggested by what appears to be a vestigial loading gate just behind the cylinder.  Curiously, the rebated cylinder (note how the diameter steps down toward the rear) would not be authentic to either an 1849 or 1851 Colt, which seems to reinforce the idea that this is a prop.  Google ""Man With No Name Gun"" to see a similar conversion that Clint Eastwood used in the 1960s spaghetti westerns.

Oh, and the cartridges?  From the fuzzy low-res image, they appear to be .32 ACP (Automatic Colt Pistol) rounds to my eye, as they seem to be too straight-walled to be 9x19 Luger rounds, and it's just possible to discern (or imagine?) a semi-rim on the rearmost cartridge.

His past lies and activities are going to stick to him like velcro until the narrative about Hillary's dishonesty shifts to him in spades.  

By August all those republicans who jumped on the 'Trump endorsement train"" are going to be desperate for a way off. Christie, Ryan, Sullivan, Murkowski and the rest... They gave their opponents a gift that'll keep on giving for years.  And it'll be a bloodbath in November.

You are raising the old canard about ""foreign buyers"" (roll eyes).

You seem, strangely, to somehow think that ""foreign buyers"" was my subject, where I actually wrote about OVERSEAS MONEY.

They are not the same thing. The HUGE amount of money that has flooded into Vancouver has come from overseas money, and it is only a minority fraction of that which has been from foreigners. Most of the overseas money has arrived in recent decades  in the hands of investor immigrants.

The reason houses have been soaring in price in Vancouver, now at dozens of times the average annual local income, is because of that overseas money.

Are you new to these boards? Most regular readers realized long ago that there is no way - zero - zilch - for houses prices in a Canadian city to reach, based on local workers, dozens of times the average annual local income. It is an economic and physical impossibility.

Overseas money is the mechanism that caused this.",test,2017-09-23 01:05:23.986429+00,54,6003340.0,380892,approved,0,0,0,13,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,4

R. McGuire and  Robert Price dispute the Pauline authorship of Galatians. Price purports it was written by Marcion: R. M. Price, “The Pre-Nicene New Testament” (2006).

The nature of the property found in one's possession can be determinative of guilt from a court's point of view.

Once again, you demonstrate the fact that antifluoridationists have no understanding of what constitutes valid evidence.  Donna did not present ""Canadian data"".  She presented her unsubstantiated claim as to what she deems was done by the Ministry of Health, and her own interpretation of what she claims was found in some ""collected data"".  This is nothing but anecdotal personal opinion.  If she desires credibility for her claims she will need to properly cite where this data may be found such that it can be viewed at its original source, verified for accuracy of what she claims, and considered in its proper context.

The information I provided was a direct quote from the McLaren study, which I properly cited.

Antifluoridationists will never understand that they can't just state whatever unsubstantiated claims they wish, and expect that to be accorded credence.

“I'm a Liberal on healthcare, we have to take care of people... I love universal.”

And he told The Advocate in February 2000: “I would put forth a comprehensive health care program and fund it with an increase in corporate taxes.”

In 2000, Trump wrote a book called The America We Deserve, in which he praised universal healthcare systems:

Marginal rates are fairly straightforward as you pointed out. Reputable organizations have published very different estimates for 'EFFECTIVE' tax rates that corps. Pay. The most recent estimate comes from the World Bank and International Finance Commission, which put the U. S. EFFECTIVE rate for 2014 at 27.9 percent. That’s second-highest behind New Zealand among OECD countries and 15th-highest among the 189 countries measured.

In 2011, the Tax Foundation published a survey of 13 prior estimates of the United States’ effective tax rate from 2005 to 2011.

What differs is how we answer ""how much health care are citizens entitled to at what cost?"" In health care for those under age 65, as in many things, Canada values solidarity more and liberty less than the US. In typically American fashion, I care less about population-level outcomes than I do about individual access, cost, and incentives for responsible behavior. With the growth of retail medicine in the US, prices for routine care are becoming lower and increasing transparent. What US citizens would like is access to pharmaceuticals at foreign prices. Then we wouldn't be shouldering the cost of drug development for the rest of the world.

This economy isn't like the 1950's, where jobs were everywhere and rents were reasonable. In a lot of cities, rents are driven to insane heights, and the competition for jobs means many are homeless, or just hanging on. 

Until there are changes in our type of capitalism that exports jobs and imports wealth through Wall Street, nothing will change. 
Me, I have given up on explaining in comments sections. Pretty much all people know are the few on the street who have given up and are living rough. 
I am not a cruel person, I don't think, but do wish this country had fallen in the last economic crash to the point that we had a depression. Maybe then people would understand what happens when one is lost and alone.
